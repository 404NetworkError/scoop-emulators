    "description": "MasterGear (MG) is a program that emulates 8bit SEGA videogames on your computer. It runs games made for SEGA MasterSystem (Mark3 in Japan) and GameGear, as well as their predecessors: SG1000, SC3000, SF7000, and Mark2. MG will also help hobbyists who still write software for these systems to debug their works without using rare and costly development hardware.",
