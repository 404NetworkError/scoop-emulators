## How do I use this?

scoop bucket add emulators https://github.com/detain/scoop-emulators
scoop list
scoop install <emulator>
scoop update
scoop update *
scoop uninstall <emulator>
```

## Emulator List

(removed for now)

* [üè†](http://www.zsnes.com/) [üì•](https://consolo.is.cc/emu/zsnes/1.51.7z) [zsnes](./bucket/zsnes.json) zsnes is a SNES emulator that suffers from low accuracy when compared to higan and snes9x. Most of znes‚Äôs development focused on achieving portability and performance, with the bulk of the emulator being written in x86 assembly.

## Development Notes

* I setup the [bin/checkhealth.sh](./bin/checkhealth.sh) script to run the checkvers.ps1, checkurls.ps1, and missing-checkurls.ps1 scripts hiding the results without problems

### Issues and To-Do

* Improve [checkver, autoupdate](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop/wiki/App-Manifest-Autoupdate), and [persist](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop/wiki/Persistent-data) usage
* Cache files in another repo to circumvent expiring download links
